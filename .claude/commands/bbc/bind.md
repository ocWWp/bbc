description: Bind an adapter to a role (or change an existing binding) via queue

<objective>
Update `memory/ops/bindings.yaml` to bind a role to an active adapter. Used when:
- A previously unbound role gets its first adapter (e.g., binding `image-edit-provider` to a new candidate).
- A role's binding changes from one adapter to another (vendor swap).
- A provisional binding flips to permanent.

This command does NOT activate adapters or run the F1 ranker. It records the binding decision after the human (or future ranker) has made it.
</objective>

<process>
1. Detect layer. Refuse unless `layer == manager` or `layer == main`.

2. Ask the user for:
   - `--role <role-id>` — must exist at `memory/ops/provider-roles/<role>.yaml`.
   - `--provider <provider-id>` — must exist as an `active` adapter at `memory/ops/providers/<id>.yaml`. Refuse if status is `candidate` (caller must promote to active first via separate proposal), `deprecated` (use `/bbc:decommission` instead), or `archived` (impossible).

3. Validate that the named adapter declares `implements: [<role-id>]`. Refuse with: "Adapter `<provider>` does NOT implement role `<role>`. Update the adapter's `implements:` field first via a separate proposal."

4. Read the current binding for the role from `memory/ops/bindings.yaml`. Determine the diff:
   - If currently `(unbound)` → adding a binding.
   - If currently bound to a different active provider → swap (with implicit decom expectation; warn user to consider `/bbc:decommission` for the replaced one).
   - If currently bound to the same provider → no-op; print message and exit.

5. Construct a single-hunk diff against `bindings.yaml` updating the row for the role.

6. File a queue proposal via `propose.sh`:
   - `--target main --file memory/ops/bindings.yaml --kind edit --source "<user-cited reason or pick_trace ref>"`.

7. If F1's `rank.sh` produced a `pick_trace` for this binding, attach the trace as evidence in the proposal body alongside the diff. Manager review will check the trace against the profile's hard constraints.

8. Print the proposal_id. Tell user: "Manager review next, then `/bbc:accept` to apply."
</process>

<refusal_examples>
- "/bbc:bind must run from `bbc/manager/` or repo root."
- "Role `<role>` does not exist."
- "Adapter `<provider>` is `candidate` — promote to `active` first."
- "Adapter `<provider>` does not declare `implements: [<role>]`."
- "Role `<role>` is already bound to `<provider>` (no change)."
- "Replacing `<old>` with `<new>` — recommend running /bbc:decommission for `<old>` separately."
</refusal_examples>

<known_limitations>
- Provisional bindings are still recorded with the parens hack `(provisional: <id>)` per F4-build-1 SUMMARY gap #4. A future schema upgrade adds a `provisional: true` flag.
- This command does NOT call `rank.sh` itself. F1-build-4 (binding-update integration) will compose `/bbc:bind` with the ranker.
